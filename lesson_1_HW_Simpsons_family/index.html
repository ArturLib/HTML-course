        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson_family" target="_blank">Simpson family</a> consists of
        fictional characters featured in the animated television series The Simpsons. The Simpsons are a nuclear family
        consisting of:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#hs">Homer</a></li>
            <li><a href="#ms">Marge</a></li>
            <li><a href="#bs">Bart</a></li>
            <li><a href="#ls">Lisa</a></li>
            <li><a href="#mgs">Maggie</a></li>
        </ul>
        They live at 742 Evergreen Terrace in the fictional town of Springfield, United States, and they were created
        by cartoonist Matt Groening, who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart"
        for his own name. The family debuted on Fox on April 19, 1987, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" and
        were later spun off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the U.S. on December 17, 1989. <br>
        Alongside the five main family members, there are a number of other major and minor characters in their family.
        The most commonly recurring characters are Homer's father Abraham "Grampa" Simpson; Marge's sisters Patty and
        Selma Bouvier; and the family's two pets, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. Other family members include
        Homer's mother Mona Simpson, Homer's half-brother Herbert Powell, Marge's mother Jacqueline Bouvier,
        and other minor relatives.
