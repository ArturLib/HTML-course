    <h1>Volvo P1800</h1>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_P1800" target="_blank">Volvo P1800</a> is a 2+2, front-engine,
        rear-drive sports car manufactured and marketed by Volvo Cars between 1961 and 1973. Originally a coupé
        (1961–1972), it was also offered in a shooting-brake configuration toward the end of its production (1972–1973).
        Styling was by Pelle Petterson under the tutelage of Pietro Frua when Frua's studio was a subsidiary of the
        Italian carrozzeria Ghia, and the mechanicals were derived from Volvo's Amazon/122 series.
        <br>
        Marketed as a touring car rather than a sports car, the P1800 became widely known when driven by British actor
        Roger Moore in the television series The Saint, which aired from 1962 to 1969.

    <h2>Record-breaking 1800</h2>

    <p>
        A 1966 Volvo 1800S and its owner Irv Gordon of East Patchogue, New York, USA own the Guinness world record for
        highest mileage in the same vehicle he has been driving for more than 45 years. It had covered in excess of
        2,219,751 miles (3,572,343 km) by March 2004, and passed the 2,600,000-mile (4,200,000 km) mark by October 2007.
        As of August, 2009, the car is at 2.7 million miles and the owner is now targeting the three million mile mark.
        <br>
        He has driven about 26,000 of those miles outside of the U.S., in Canada and Mexico, as well as in Europe. "In
        Sweden, we drove to Volvo's global headquarters to see where the P1800 was born", Gordon said.
        <br>
        On April 2, 2002, Gordon and his 1800S were guests on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, after reaching the two
        million milestone.
        <br>
        As of July 2010, Gordon reached 2.8 million miles for his 70th birthday, and announced that he hopes to reach 3
        million by the time he turns 73. That feat will require him to drive an average of around 5,500 miles per month.
